      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart.
        Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases,
        such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias);
        and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among
        others. The term "heart disease" is often used interchangeably with the
        term "cardiovascular disease." Cardiovascular disease generally refers
        to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can
        lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart
        conditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves or
        rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease. Many forms of heart
        disease can be prevented or treated with healthy lifestyle choices.
